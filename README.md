# CSU44061-Group-Project

## Motivation
One of the most common ways that people interact with predictive algorithms is through weather forecasts. Unfortunately, as you might know, quite often, when you check the weather forecast, it does a poor job of predicting what the weather will actually look like. Living in Ireland, we can tend to see all four seasons of weather in a day, and as we know the weather can affect so many aspects of your day, from the traffic to our moods. So, how predictable is the weather? With this project, we would like to look and learn about the different types of modeling that can be done with machine learning around the weather and we would like to understand the difficulties around predicting weather forecasts.

## Dataset
The public-apis GitHub has a good list of weather APIs that exist out on the internet: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#weather. We will either use AccuWeather or the US Weather API depending on how we develop our program. If neither of these APIs suits our needs, we will look at the other APIs in this list and research further if need be. We have started using these APIs to build our own dataset however there are plenty of weather datasets online that we will look at using if need be. Met.ie has historical data for weather from Merrion Square which will be the other dataset we will use if need be.

## Method
After researching online, there seem to be many different machine learning algorithms from logistic regression to deep learning that are used for predicting the weather. Therefore we will test out multiple different classifiers in order to find which one performs the best. We have studied a variety of classification algorithms so far, and we will use cross-validation to observe the accuracy of each one to determine which is best suited to our dataset. 

## Intended experiments
Once we have created our models, we intend to test them on real-life scenarios by providing current weather data and predicting what the weather will look like in the future. Once we have the predictions, we will look to see if that is reflected in the real weather history.
